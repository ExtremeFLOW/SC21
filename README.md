# ExtremeFLOW test-suite
This is a test-suite for benchmarking and verification of high-order spectral element based flow solvers.

It currently consinst of:

* Turbulent pipe flow, Re_\tau=180 [1]
* Taylor-Green vortex, Re=1600 and Re=5000
* Interaction of a flat-plate boundary layer with an isolated hemispherical roughness element at Re_\delta = 700 [2]
